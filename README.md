# Analyzing El Cerrito Police Data
This is just a side project that started when I stumbled upon my local police department's open data. 
So far I have just completed some cursory statistics and a heatmap of crime data from 2017. I primarily
used Pandas, GeoPandas, and OSMNX to analyze data and create the maps.
